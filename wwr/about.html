                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Splash began as a dream in 1998, when two college buddies, Matt and Lisa, took a life-changing white-water rafting trip.
                       Inspired by the exhilarating rapids and stunning scenery, they vowed to share the experience.
                       Starting with a single raft on a local river, Splash has grown into a respected company. Over the years,
                       they've expanded their routes, honed their expertise, and remain dedicated to providing unforgettable adventures for all.
